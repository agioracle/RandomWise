    <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4 text-sm">By RandomWise Team Â· 2025-04-17</p>

    <p className="mb-4">Picture this: It&apos;s 3,000 BCE, and you&apos;re a potter trying to decide which design to put on your next clay vessel. You grab a piece of wood, carve some notches into it, give it a spin, and voilÃ â€”decision made! Little did that ancient potter know they were pioneering one of humanity&apos;s most enduring decision-making tools: the spinning wheel.</p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">From Ancient Wheels to Digital Spins ðŸŽ¡</h3>

        <p className="mb-4">The concept of using spinning objects for decision-making isn&apos;t new. Ancient civilizations used everything from spinning tops to marked wheels to make choices, settle disputes, and even predict the future. The Romans had their &ldquo;rota fortunae&rdquo; (wheel of fortune), while medieval Europeans used spinning wheels for games and fair distribution of resources.</p>

    <p className="mb-4">Fast forward to the 20th century, and spinning wheels became TV stars! Game shows like &ldquo;Wheel of Fortune&rdquo; turned the humble decision wheel into entertainment gold, proving that there&apos;s something universally captivating about watching a wheel spin and waiting to see where it lands.</p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Enter the Digital Age: Your Pocket-Sized Wheel ðŸ“±</h3>
